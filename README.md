# Faceter
![rock.gif](rock.gif)

Faceter is a tool for generating irregular 3D geometries in Three.js using an iterative fractal noise approach. The intended use case for this library is to render realistic rocks and stones. However, depending on the value of the arguments, Faceter can also produce bizarre and dramatic distortion of even simple geometric forms.
