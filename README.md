# Faceter

Faceter is a library for generating irregular 3D geometries in Three.JS with an iterative fractal noise approach. The intended use case for this library is to render realistic rocks and stones. However, depending on the value of the arguments, Faceter can also produce bizarre and dramatic distortion of even simple geometric forms.
